# [Free Underground Tekno Radio](https://www.facebook.com/Free.Underground.Tekno.Radio/) line up @ [WebTeK XVII](https://www.facebook.com/events/473975483781586)

- If you already reserved your slot you will receive Free Underground Tekno Radio stream key for Facebook page some days before the event
- If you still need support to setup and play I'll help of course, happy to make everything works as expected ([mail me](fabrizio.salmi@gmail.com), [PM me on Telegram/whatsapp](+393409727857) or DM me on [FB](https://www.facebook.com/streaming.teknival/)/[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fab_spaceinvaders/)
- If you scared about copyright issues (some records are protected by distributors ofc) you will receive a stream key for Periscope/Twitter which should works better that way
- I will boost audience for some sessions using restream.io pro account (due to multiple-platform stream sessions at the same time), this is completely transparent you don't need to do anything as performer /streamer

All stream sessions will be shared to the following spaces:

- [WebTeK FB page](https://www.facebook.com/Worldwide.Streaming.Teknival/)
- [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/473975483781586)
